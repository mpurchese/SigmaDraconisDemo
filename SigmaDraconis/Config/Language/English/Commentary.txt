# First arrival comments
1		I'm here!  I'm the first!  Let's get building!
2		So I'm the first to arrive.  Quite a responsibility!
10		[name] the engineer checking in.  Ready to start work!
20		[name] here.  It'll be my job to harvest and grow food.
21		[name] the botanist checking in.  Ready to start work!
30		[name] the geologist here.  Ready to start scanning!
31		[name] the geologist checking in.  Ready to start work!
90		I've finally arrived!  This is so exciting!!

# Urgent warnings etc.
100		I'm getting dehydrated, not feeling well.
110		I'm so hungry, not feeling well.
120		So cold!
190		The mothership is ready to start waking another colonist.

# Early game hints
200		We have a resource processor prefab.  Let's build it.
205		There are resources nearby. I suggest getting stone first.
210		The ground is soft. Most structures will need foundations.
215		Once I've got enough stone I can build a charcoal maker.
220		Charcoal makers use organics, I can get these from plants.
225		Charcoal makers are slow, so more than one would be good.
232		I'll need water regularly so we should prepare for this...
233		We already have a prefab for a groundwater pump.
234		I won't need my landing pod again, but I do need metal.
235		I feel thirsty, should make a water dispenser now.
240		I'm feel hungry, should make a food dispenser now.
245		I feel a bit thirsty, should make a water dispenser soon.
250		I'm starting to feel hungry, should make a food dispenser.
254		I feel very tired and I still haven't built a sleep pod!
255		I feel tired, need to build a sleep pod now.
260		I'll start getting tired soon, should build a sleep pod.
265		Stone furnaces make metal from ore and coal / charcoal.
270		The furnace needs some ore.
275		Let's wake a botanist, they know all about producing food.
278		Let's wake a geologist, they'll find resources for mining.
280		A mush churn will be needed as a temporary food source.
285		Let's wake another colonist, I'm all alone!

# Thirst, hunger, sleep.  Order in descending importance
305		I feel very thirsty, why is there no water dispenser?
310		I feel very thirsty.
315		I feel very hungry and there is no food!
320		I feel very hungry, why is there no food dispenser?
325		I feel very hungry.
330		I feel hungry and there is no food!
335		I feel thirsty, where is the water dispenser?
340		I feel hungry, where is the food dispenser?
345		I'm getting very tired and there is nowhere to sleep!
350		I'm very tired and there is no available sleep pod!
355		I'm getting very tired now.
360		I'm tired and there is nowhere to sleep!
365		I'm tired and there is no available sleep pod.

# Botanist hints
400		We can't eat raw food, so a cooker will be needed!
405		Farming takes a long time, maybe there are native fruits?
410		We don't have any food.  Is there anything I can do?

# Geologist hints
500		It may be worth scanning near rocks on the surface.

# Engineer hints
600		We don't have any food.  Should I build a mush churn?
601		We don't have any food.  Can we use our mush churn?
610		I expect we'll need to generate more power soon.
615		Solar panel output is declining as the sun goes down...
616		We really need to build a generator before it gets dark.
620		We're low on power.  Could be a big problem!
621		We need to generate more power, or turn something off.
630		Our silos are full.  We should do something about that!
631		We could build silos or stack stuff on the ground.
632		Our silos are full.
633		We need more storage for our food.
634		Our storage space for food is completely full.

# General observations
2000	The giant plants here must benefit from the low gravity.
2001	I wonder why the grass evolved to grow so tall?
2002	Wow this grass stuff is huge!  Nothing like it at home.
2010	Big red and yellow flowers.  Pretty.
2011	Giant flowers and enormous bees.  I love this place!
2012	The flowers here are quite nice, I guess.
2021	The white "flowers" are actually seed pods, not flowers.
2030	I wonder what makes these blue flowers glow in the dark?
2031	The glowing blue plants attract insects for pollination.
2040	Mmm a ruadu plant.  I like ruadu.
2041	Redfruit plants (ruadu-dax) take a few days to grow.
2042	Those are ruadu plants.  One of my favourite foods!
2050	That's a yunndu bush.  I wonder when it will fruit?
2051	Yunndu bushes grow slowly but it's worth the wait.
2052	Those yunndu (yellowfruit) will be ripe soon.
2060	The boldu-dax have pretty yellow flowers now.
2061	The lamp light has ripened the boldu. Interesting!
2070	These trees can provide us with a lot of fuel.
2071	We have trees a bit like this on the homeworld.
2072	The trees remind me of home, a bit.
2100	There are so many resources to collect on this world.
2101	Coal rocks on the surface.  Don't get this at home!
2200	We can make rocket fuel using hydrogen from the water.
2201	I like being by the water.  Many plants like it too.
2202	The water is very calm here.
2300	Yikes that' a giant bug!  Luckily it seems harmless.
2301	I noticed that the red bugs hide under bushes at night.
2302	Everything here has to have a way to survive the cold.
2303	These shiny blue bugs live in wet areas.
2310	A granux (greenback).  Big and slow with a hard shell.
2311	These granuxi like to eat the same fruit that we do.
2312	There's a big green animal lumbering around.  Huh.
2400	Automatic mines are a fantastic invention.
2402	These solar panels track the sun to optimise output.
2403	With composites we'll be able to build wind turbines.
2404	Wind turbines work best when placed in an open area.
2405	Now we can build batteries.  We should do so!
2410	Now we can build stone planters, cheaper than hydroponics.
2420	Pleased that we've got our first power station completed.
2421	Now we should make sure we have plenty of fuel to run it.
2430	We have a biology lab now!  Let's get to work!
2490	We have a rocket!! Now just need enough fuel to launch it.
2491	Our rocket is reasy to launch. Let's go!
2500	It's getting nice and warm now, I like it.
2501	The shadows are getting long. The sun will set soon.
2502	The shadows are getting long. It'll soon be night again.
2510	The sun is right on the horizon. Soon it will be dark.
2520	The temperature is dropping quickly now.
2530	It's below freezing now. It's going to get really cold.
2532	Too chilly for some but I'm fine with this temperature.
2534	It's really hot now, but that doesn't bother me at all.
2600	It's quite difficult working in the dark.
2601	It's hard to work in the dark, we should build some lamps.

# General comments (social)
4000	I'm very glad I decided to study [skill] as a youngling.

# World info
5000	Interstellar travel would be impossible without coldsleep.
5001	The journey is incredibly long, but I think it's worth it.
5002	I wonder what has changed on the homeworld since we left?
5003	It took us nearly 800 standard years to get here.
5004	Xantha's rings are an amazing sight in the night sky.
5005	Even in daytime you can see Xantha hanging in the sky.
5006	Xaralox orbits the giant planet Xantha every 192 hours.
5007	The planet Xantha has an amazing ring system.
5008	The homeworld system has two gas giants.  Only one here.
5009	Sigma Draconis 1 is high in metal.  One day we'll mine it.
5010	Sigma Draconis 2 is too hot for life, not like here.
5011	Sigma Draconis 4 is too far from the sun to live on.
5012	Like most gas giants, Xantha has a lot of moons.
5013	You can see a few of the other moons in the night sky.
5014	This world, Xaralox, is really big for a moon.
5015	There are many other small islands like this one.
5016	We called this moon Xaralox after an ancient scientist.
5017	Xantha is the third planet in the Sigma Draconis system.
5018	This moon, Xaralox, is also called Sigma Draconis 3b.
5019	Inhabitable worlds are rare, so this one is very special.
5020	The air here is similar to on our homeworld, but cleaner.
5030	It'll take some getting used to the day length here.
5040	Weight restictions meant we couldn't bring much with us.
5041	Interstellar travel is still incredibly expensive.
