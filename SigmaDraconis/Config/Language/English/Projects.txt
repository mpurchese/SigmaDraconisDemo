4	Grow in the Dark Algae		Allows algae to grow in the dark at a reduced rate.|Time to complete: 12 hours
5	Cold Water Algae			Reduces the growth rate penalty for low temperature.|Time to complete: 9 hours
6	Hydroponics					Hydroponics planters can grow food relatively|quickly (20% faster than stone planters).|They are ideal for getting a good quality food|supply in place as soon as possible.||However they are relatively expensive to make,|consume 0.4 units of water per hour, and can|only grow jarbo, bolbo, and prondu.||Unlocks hydroponics planter.|Time to complete: 4 hours
7	Improved Hydroponics		Increases growth rate of crops in hydroponics planters by 15%.|Time to complete: 12 hours
8	Compost Production			Our crops cannot grow directly in the local soil.|This means that stone planters require compost to be|manufactured from organics, which takes time.||However in the long term stone planters are|ideal for large-scale food production as they|are cheap to make, have a low water consumption,|and can grow all types of crops except for prondu.||Unlocks compost factory and stone planter.|Time to complete: 12 hours
9	Faster Compost Production	Compost factories will work 25% more quickly.|Time to complete: 9 hours
10	Improved Compost			Plants grown in stone planters will mature 15% more quickly.|Time to complete: 12 hours
11	Kek Production				Allows kekke to be grown in stone planters,|and unlocks the Kek Factory and Kek Dispenser.|Kek is a drink that reduces stress when consumed.|Time to complete: 12 hours
12	Improved Kek				Drinking kek grants a +2 happiness bonus for 24 hours.|Time to complete: 12 hours
101	Battery Cells				Enables the production of batteries,|to increase our energy storage capacity.|Unlocks Battery Cell Factory and Battery.|Time to complete: 12 hours
102	Lightweight Composites		Lightweight plastic composites are needed to|manufacture wind turbine blades.|Unlocks Composites Factory and Wind Turbine.|Time to complete: 18 hours
103	Photovoltaics				Semiconducting materials allow electricity to be|generated directly from sunlight.|Unlocks Solar Cell Factory and Solar Panel Array.|Time to complete: 18 hours
