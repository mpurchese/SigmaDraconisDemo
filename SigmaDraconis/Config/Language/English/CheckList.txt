ITEM 20
TITLE Obtain metal
TEXT1 Press X or the recycle icon in|the bottom-left to activate the|deconstruction tool.
TEXT2 The landing pod is no-longer needed|- and it's made of metal.||Tip: There is no need collect all the metal|right away. Once we have a couple of units,|you change the prioriry to "none"|to stop any more from being collected.

ITEM 30
TITLE Obtain stone
TEXT1 Press X or the recycle icon in|the bottom-left to activate the|deconstruction tool.
TEXT2 There should be some rocks nearby.|Rocks can contain stone, ore, or coal.||Find a stone rock, and deconstruct it.||Tip: Most contruction requires metal and / or|stone, so it's important to always have a|source of both.

ITEM 40
TITLE Construct foundation
TEXT1 Build at least one|foundation.
TEXT2 Foundations are required for most buildings.|they can be made from either stone or metal.||Tip: Metal is more expensive to produce than|stone. For this reason stone foundations are|oftern preferred.

ITEM 50
TITLE Establish water supply
TEXT1 Build a groundwater pump|and a water dispenser.
TEXT2 The first groundwater pump is free.|The water dispenser requires 2 metal.||Tip: The operational effeciency of|groundwater pumps may vary with location.|Also, they have a drying effect which will|gradually decrease output over time.

ITEM 60
TITLE Obtain coal or build a charcoal maker

ITEM 70
TITLE Obtain organics
TEXT1 Deconstruct plants for organics.
TEXT2 Organics are a vital resource with a|variety of different uses.||Tip: Try to avoid deconstructing plants|with "du-dax" in the name.|These produce fruit which will|be a useful source of food later.

ITEM 80
TITLE Obtain ore
TEXT1 Ore is needed to smelt metal.
TEXT2 Check the rocks nearby,|some should contain ore.||Tip: Rocks sometimes indicate the presence|of hidden underground resources in the area.|You can use the geology tool (G) to flag|locations to survey in the future.

ITEM 90
TITLE Build a furnace
TEXT1 The stone furnace is on page 2|of the construction menu.
TEXT2 The stone furnace will automatically produce|metal as long as we have both ore and coal.||Tip: Electric furnaces are much faster than|stone ones and don't need coal. However they|require a large amount of energy to operate,|so it's best to build stone furnaces first.

ITEM 95
TITLE Build another charcoal maker
TEXT1 Charcoal makers are slow.
TEXT2 It takes two charcoal makers to keep one|stone furnace running continuously.||Tip: Keep an eye on the level of organics;|the charcoal makers need a continuous supply.

ITEM 100
TITLE Build a food dispenser
TEXT1 The food dispenser is on the fisrt|page of the construction menu.
TEXT2 We have a small amount of food in the lander,|but a food dispenser is required before it|can be consumed.||2 metal is required to build a dispenser.

ITEM 110
TITLE Build a sleep pod
TEXT1 The sleep pod is on page 6|of the construction menu.

ITEM 120
TITLE Wake another colonist
TEXT1 Click the button in the bottom-left|to wake another colonist

TEXT2 Colonists can only eat cooked food, so a|cooker is needed unless we plan to survive|on mush. Botanists also cannot harvest fruit|until a cooker is available.||Tip: Cookers require water to operate.|It might be worth building another pump.

ITEM 140
TITLE Build a mush churn
TEXT1 The mush churn is on page 3|of the construction menu.
TEXT2 Hopefully botanists will eventually be able|to grow and harvest enough to feed the colony,|but early on we will almost certainly need|a mush churn.||A mush churn can convert organics, water and|energy into low quality food (mush).

ITEM 150
TITLE Harvest and cook fruit
TEXT1 Some wild plants produce edible fruit.|Press H to activate the harvest tool.
TEXT2 Eventually we should grow our own crops, but|this is a long-term goal.||For now edible wild fruit|could be a useful food source.||Tip: Bluefruit plants fruit early in the day.|Yellow and red fruit come later.

ITEM 180
TITLE Build glass factory
TEXT1 The glass factory is on page 2|of the construction menu.
TEXT2 The glass factory converts stone into glass.||Glass rooms can be temperature-controlled,|providing a comfortable environment in which|to work, sleep, relax, and grow food.

ITEM 181
TITLE Build glass factory
TEXT1 The glass factory is on page 2|of the construction menu.

ITEM 191
TITLE Construct a room
TEXT1 The glass factory is on page 6|of the construction menu.
TEXT2 To complete this item enclose an area of at|least 6 tiles with glass walls and a door.|Then add a roof and an environment control.||Tip: Heating costs energy.|Make sure we have plenty of fuel before it|gets too cold for colonists to go outside.

ITEM 192
TITLE Have a pump indoors
TEXT1 Pumps, water pumps and mush churns|have a minimum operating temperature.
TEXT2 All of these buildings will stop working when|the temperature drops below -10°C.||Alternatively we could use directional|heaters to keep them warm, but these do use|quite a lot of energy.

ITEM 195
TITLE Build a table
TEXT1 Tables are page 6|of the construction menu.
TEXT2 A table can be made from stone or metal.|Colonists will visit a table to relax and|socialise.  Make sure there is some space|around it for this purpose.||Tip: Ideally it's good to have a table|indoors but they need plenty of space,|so it might be best to put one outside first.

ITEM 198
TITLE Assign private sleep pods to everyone
TEXT1 Colonists like to have their own|private pod.
TEXT2 Colonists get a small happiness bonus after|sleeping if the pod is assigned just to them.||If you have enough pods, you can click on|each one and assign to a different colonist.||Note that after assigning a pod, this cannot|be changed again for 24 hours.

ITEM 240
TITLE Build a mine
TEXT1 The mine is on page 2|of the construction menu.
TEXT2 Collecting resources is time consuming, and|will get more so as the nearby rocks are|used up.

ITEM 250
TITLE Build a power station
TEXT1 Power stations are|on page 4 of the construction menu.
TEXT2 Power stations are more efficient than|generators but are very expensive to build.||Tip: The coal power station is somewhat more|efficient than the biomass, but it's more|expensive and you'll need a few charcoal|makers or a coal mine to keep it running.

ITEM 260
TITLE Build a food storage
TEXT1 The food storage is on page 5|of the construction menu.
TEXT2 We're running out of food storage space.||Tip: Unlike raw materials, food and mush|cannot be stored outside in stacking areas.|If you have too much mush, switch off the|mush churn or set an inventory target.|Mush can also be burned in a biomass power|station or turned into compost.

TITLE Wake another colonist
TEXT1 Click the button in the bottom-left|to wake another colonist
TEXT2 The fourth colonist could be another engineer,|botanist, geologist, or the programmer.||Tip: There is only one programmer on the|mothership.  Xe is excellent at operating|labs, but won't do any other work.

# This is similar to item 290 but for the harsh climate - best not to get too many colonists on day one.
ITEM 291
TITLE Wake another colonist
TEXT1 Click the button in the bottom-left|to wake another colonist
TEXT2 The fourth colonist could be another engineer,|botanist, geologist, or the programmer.||Tip: The more colonists you have, the more|resources you will need to survive the night.|It may be advisable to wait until day two|before waking more colonists.

ITEM 520
TITLE Build an ore scanner
TEXT1 The ore scanner is on page 2|of the construction menu.
TEXT2 An ore scanner will systematically scan tiles|in an expanding circle around its location.||Tip: Ore scanners do use some power (2kW).|It's not much, but you might want to|switch them off if you're low on energy.

ITEM 600
TITLE Grow, harvest, and cook some crops
TEXT1 You'll need at least one planter|and a cooker.
TEXT2 Check the colonists' preferences and the|requirements of different crops before|deciding what to plant.||Tip: Crops take a long time to grow.|It is suggested that a colony should have|at least two planters for each colonist.

ITEM 630
TITLE Build a composites or solar cell factory
TEXT1 These are on page 2|of the construction menu.
TEXT2 The composites factory is needed before we|can build wind turbines.||The solar cell factory is needed for|solar panels.||Both are needed before we can construct|a rocket.

ITEM 640
TITLE Build a solar panel array or a wind turbine
TEXT1 These are on page 4|of the construction menu.
TEXT2 Solar panels can be placed anywhere and|produce a small amount of energy all day.||Wind turbines should be spaced well apart|in open areas.  They can produce a lot of|energy but won't work all of the time.

ITEM 650
TITLE Build an algae pool
TEXT1 The algae pool is on page 2|of the construction menu.
TEXT2 Algae pools generate organics over time.|Growth rate depends on temperature and light.||Tip: These require a lot of water to start|each production cycle.  You might want to|build a water storage if you haven't already.
